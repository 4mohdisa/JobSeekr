# Build notes

Decisions taken where the spec left a choice open, plus anything a later block
needs to know. Factual record, not a changelog.

## Block A — Core

### Config (`backend/config.py`)

- **`browser_profile_dir` is a field, not a property.** The spec lists it both as
  a Browser setting defaulting to `data_dir / "browser_profile"` and as a derived
  path. A field cannot default to the value of another field, so it is declared
  `Optional[Path] = None` and a `model_validator(mode="after")` fills it with
  `data_dir / "browser_profile"` when unset. Net effect: it follows a relocated
  `DATA_DIR`, and `BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR` in `.env` still overrides it. Callers can
  treat it as always populated; the annotation stays `Optional` only because
  pydantic validates before the validator runs.
- **Blank env values mean "unset".** A `_blank_is_unset` before-validator maps
  `KEY=` (empty or whitespace) to `None`. Without it, `APPLY_WARMUP_START_DATE=`
  raises a validation error and, worse, an empty `GMAIL_OAUTH_TOKEN_FILE=` would
  become `Path(".")` — a credential path silently pointing at the working
  directory. A blank *required* key now fails loudly, which is the correct
  outcome for a typo'd `.env`.
- **`stop_file` is not created by `ensure_directories()`.** It is a file whose
  *existence* is the kill switch — creating it would halt the apply loop on first
  run. Its parent is `data_dir`, which is created.
- **`managed_directories`** exists so the directory list has one definition;
  `ensure_directories()` walks it. Anything that needs to enumerate the data tree
  should use it rather than re-listing paths.
- **Relative default paths.** `data_dir="data"` and `sqlite:///data/app.db`
  resolve against the working directory. Intentional: the app is launched from
  the repo root by Task Scheduler, and an absolute default would be wrong on the
  Windows target. Set `DATA_DIR` to an absolute path if that ever changes.
- **Model defaults.** All four generative slots default to `anthropic/claude-opus-5`
  and embeddings to `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (LiteLLM identifiers). Cost is
  the user's call, not a default — `LLM_MODEL_CLASSIFY` is the one to downgrade
  first (e.g. `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`) if the $25/month cap bites, since
  classification is the high-volume, low-judgement path. Model names appear here
  and in `.env.example` only.
- **`llm_warn_fraction` is a fraction, not a percentage** (0.8 = warn at 80% of cap).
- **`apply_warmup_start_date` defaults to `None`,** meaning "no ramp configured".
  Guardrails decide what that implies; config does not encode the policy.

### Logging (`backend/logging_setup.py`)

- **Console renderer is chosen by `app_env == "local"`,** as specified. Colours are
  left to structlog's own terminal detection (`ConsoleRenderer` defaults) rather
  than forced, because the Windows target runs both in a terminal and under Task
  Scheduler with no TTY.
- **`get_logger()` calls `configure_logging()` on first use.** Module-level
  `log = get_logger(__name__)` is the normal pattern; lazy configuration means such
  a module can never silently drop events because `main()` had not run yet.
  `configure_logging()` itself is guarded by a module flag and takes `force=True`
  to rebuild (used by tests that need to re-point the log file).
- **Root handlers are cleared before install** so a second `configure_logging(force=True)`
  cannot double-log.
- **File handler rotates** at 10 MB x 5 backups. Unattended overnight runs write a
  lot; an unbounded log file on a single-user Windows box is a real risk.
  `format_exc_info` is in the file chain only — the console renderer formats
  exceptions itself.

### DB (`backend/db.py`)

- **PRAGMA hook is registered on the `Engine` class, not the instance,** so any
  engine created later (tests, Alembic) gets the same SQLite tuning. It no-ops for
  non-`sqlite3` connections so a non-SQLite URL is unaffected.
- **`init_db()` does not create tables.** Alembic owns schema. It calls
  `settings.ensure_directories()` and then ensures the SQLite file's parent exists.
- **`sqlite_path()`** parses `database_url` with `sqlalchemy.make_url` and returns
  `None` for `:memory:` / non-SQLite, so callers (backups, integrity checks) do not
  re-parse the URL string.
- **`get_session()` does not commit**; the route does. `session_scope()` commits on
  success, rolls back and logs on error — never fail silently (Claude.md).
